#### What problem are you trying to solve?:

Decentralized Insurance Configurator applied to any travel field (flights, trains, cruises etc...), potentially using any investing and reward scheme and connecting via any Ethereum Oracle. 


#### Why do you think Blockchain/SmartContract may be the right approach?:

First some details:

- Automated Insurance [UX - one step registration and automatic claims] (example: select flight number, deposit ETHs, no step 3! When the flight lands you get the payout in ETH instantly)
- Pool of investors putting Ether into a contract
- Ethereum smart contract checking Oracles for data, notifying contract for payouts. 

We think Ethereum is the only place to do a decentralized automated insurance (with automatic payouts in crypto currency) at the moment, even if there are some challenges (for example proving that you boarded the flight/train/cruise/... - for that the travel company should issue a queryable public API that the oracle can query) --- we think that this is the way to go.


#### API/DATA/Gadget you are thinking about using:

- Oraclize
- Truffle
- flightstats.com
- flighaware.com
- TFL API 
- Southern Trains API
